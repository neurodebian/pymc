Packaging is based straight on the upstream's GIT repository, which
serves as a canonical source for source distribution tarballs provided
e.g. from pypi (and source distribution tarballs do not contain the
original .pyx files for Cython).  dfsg branch tracks releases while
removing components which might be absent in upstream source
distribution (e.g. pymc/gp/Docs) and/or just duplicates of libraries
provided system-wide (e.g. atlas/blas)
